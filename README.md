<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![Screenshot from 2021-02-08 22-19-58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44641573/107252938-d438ea00-6a5b-11eb-9a94-ec38521b00a9.png)




The segregation of waste is a big problem in our society. We on a daily basis don’t understand how valuable waste segregation can be, if done by every household.

According to research done “The Savings for processing waste per household are reduced by Rs 9.53 per month and thus for the overall city the savings turnover is lakhs of rupees if waste is properly segregated and local composting is done.”

Due to carelessness or lack of awareness of above fact we people don’t categorize waste in homes.
The game involves following format and rules to play
* There is one player in the city with limited health and he has to complete the tasks to win and sustain his health.
* The player has to find the garbage piles around the city 
* As soon as the player goes near the garbage pile a pop up appears showing contents of garbage and thus he has to segrate it into appropriate categories.
* If he doesn’t put in appropriate categories he loses some health.
* After collecting garbage he has to go to dumping zones which we have two categories one is for dumping bio waste in landfill.
* The other packaging and e-waste are to be dumped in recycle plants by visiting them. This way when he finishes the collecting, segregation and dumping within given health he wins otherwise loses.
